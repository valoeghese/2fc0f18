You get the right to
- make deobfuscation mappings of the game for the purpose of mod making and education, so long as you do not profit from them
- make mods that do not make profit from the game, so long as you do not publicly share the source code of the game. You may share autogenerated .patch files to avoid this (unless I deem it sharing the source code too much)
- make addons and tools to interact with the game
- play the game
- stream and make youtube videos that are about or involve playing the game
- share screenshots and gameplay of the game

I explicity reserve the right to
- change these terms at any point
